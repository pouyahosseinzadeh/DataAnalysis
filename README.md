# DataAnalysis

You can find the problem above in the pdf file.
We are analyzing the data with Extended Kalman Filter(EKF) which is used in case of nonlinear systems.
There are some mathematical calculations which I put the final matrices and ignored explaining them.
For more information you can refer to the Kalman Filtering Techniques book "T. Soderstrom, Discrete-time Stochastic Systems, Springer London Ltd, 2nd ed., 2002. Library code: 269 - 269a."

The most important thing is that in the nonlinear systems, picking the proper initial condition and the initial covariance matrix is crucial and can extremely change the estimates.
You can pick the initial conditions by your own and observe the results.
Our goal is to estimate the state variables as close as possible with minimum error.

I will do more projects such as Robot tracking(defining the trajectory of a robot) and etc. later.
